When starting with nRF Connect SDK and Zephyr, there are many well-documented resources to wade through. This document aims to allow you to temporarily skip to the “good parts” and at the same time guide you where to find the necessary details.

This blog will provide a high-level, incomplete, and sometimes over generalized answer regarding adding a peripheral to your project. If any information contained within this document is contradicted by referenced documentation, the reference documentation is assumed to be more accurate.
